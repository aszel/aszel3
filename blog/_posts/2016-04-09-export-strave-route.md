Using Strava without a proaccount I couldn't use the routes of other cyclists.
Every time you have to create your own route which can be time consuming.
Here is a workflow to grab the routes as files and use them on Strava itself.

<br>

* Copy the URL of the Strava route you want, e.g. [https://www.strava.com/activities/123456789](https://www.strava.com/activities/123456789)
* Go to [http://strava-tools.raceshape.com/vpu/](http://strava-tools.raceshape.com/vpu/) and grab the file
* Convert that file there: [http://www.gpsies.com/convert.do](http://www.gpsies.com/convert.do)
* And upload it again to Strava: [http://labs.strava.com/gpx-to-route](http://labs.strava.com/gpx-to-route)
